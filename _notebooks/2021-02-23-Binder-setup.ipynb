    "# Getting binder to work with fast.ai\n",
    "These are my tips that helped me get it up and running. Firstly, I need to state that I mostly just followed [this](https://github.com/butchland/fastai-binder-app-template) guide by Butch Landingin. I did however meet a couple of minor hickups and that is what I'm going to explain how to fix. Secondly, I did these things on Paperspace so I cannot speak to how my tips work on Colab. So here are my tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you come across the part where you set up git on paperspace meaning this part:\n",
    " * `git config --global user.name \"<Your name>\"`\n",
    " * `git config --global user.email \"<email@address>\"`\n",
    " \n",
    "I absolutely recommend just doing that right away.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get to installing git-lfs just follow the instructions for Ubuntu/Debian except that you do not have sudo rights on paperspace so just leave the sudo out of the commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next in step 7 before running the git commands change to the directory of your git repo:\n",
    "```\n",
    "%cd <your-copy-of-fastai-binder-app-template>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly when setting up the binder remember to get these two things right.\n",
    "- Set the path to an URL path at the dropdown next to \"Launch\"\n",
    "- Have that path be /voila/render/your-notebook.ipynb\n",
