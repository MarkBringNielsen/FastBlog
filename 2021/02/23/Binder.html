<p>These are my tips that helped me get it up and running. Firstly, I need to state that I mostly just followed <a href="https://github.com/butchland/fastai-binder-app-template">this</a> guide by Butch Landingin. I did however meet a couple of minor hickups and that is what I’m going to explain how to fix. Secondly, I did these things on Paperspace so I cannot speak to how my tips work on Colab. So here are my tips:</p>

<p>When you come across the part where you set up git on paperspace meaning this part:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git config --global user.name "&lt;Your name&gt;"</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git config --global user.email "&lt;email@address&gt;"</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I absolutely recommend just doing that right away.</p>

<p>When you get to installing git-lfs just follow the instructions for Ubuntu/Debian except that you do not have sudo rights on paperspace so just leave the sudo out of the commands.</p>

<p>Next in step 7 before running the git commands change to the directory of your git repo:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>%cd &lt;your-copy-of-fastai-binder-app-template&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And lastly when setting up the binder remember to get these two things right.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set the path to an URL path at the dropdown next to “Launch”</li>
  <li>Have that path be /voila/render/your-notebook.ipynb</li>
</ul>
